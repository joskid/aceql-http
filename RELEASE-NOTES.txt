
                     AceQL HTTP
                     Version 4.0
                    Release Notes


Introduction
------------

AceQL HTTP is a secure framework of REST like HTTP APIs that allow to 
access to remote SQL databases over HTTP from any device that supports HTTP. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with two client SDKs:
- The AceQL Java Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using JDBC calls 
  in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL C# Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using Microsoft SQL 
  Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.

Security has been taken into account from the design: It as allowed to specify 
and code strong security rules in order to protect the databases. 

AceQL HTTP is licensed through the GNU Lesser General Public License 
(LGPL v2.1).


AceQL HTTP Version 4.0 - 14-Jan-2020
------------------------------------

What's New:

- SQL firewalling is now done through the SqlFirewallManager 
  interface. SqlFirewallManager concrete classes may be chained 
  to easily add new rulesets. This also allows to 
  properly isolate and reuse firewalling code.
  Default built-in implementations are provided for an easy 
  startup without any coding. 

- The new metadata API allows downloading a remote database schema
  in HTML or text format, to get a remote database main properties, 
  to get the list of tables, and to get the details of each table.
  It also allows wrapping remote tables, columns, indexes, etc. into
  easy to use provided Java, C# and Python classes in the client SDKs: 
  Table, Index, Column, etc.
  HTML and text schemas are rendered with SchemaCrawler (www.schemacrawler.com).
  The metadata API allows exposing more easily the databases along with the 
  schemas, without any need to communicate, maintain or synchronize separated
  documentation for the API users. Users are thus autonomous to explore 
  the metadata and schema of the exposed databases.  
  
- StatementAnalyzer has been retrofitted with an external heavily used 
  and highly supported SQL parser  (JSqlParser library - 
  https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser).
  
- Tomcat base libraries have been updated to 8.5.50 (Security requirements). 

- AceQL HTTP requires now Java 8 or higher.

- Stateful mode is now the main and only mode. This simplifies
  the software architecture, the user documentation and ease of 
  used for developers.
  
- DatabaseConfigurator.getConnectionMaxAge() has been removed 
  because of duplicate usage. (Same kind of value can be set when 
  defining Connection pool whatever pool system is used).
  
- DefaultSessionConfigurator: getSessionTimelife() is now 0 
  (infinite session lifetime) instead of 12 hours.
  
- Connections Store cleaning has been completely rewritten. A 
  cleaning thread is regularly launched instead of a permanent

  are  not compatible with this 1.0-beta-5 version: the login method 
  signature must be changed.
